Should you decide to checkout a copy of the plugin using SVN, make sure you correct the file permissions on your own as SVN does not preserve file permissions. I recommend the following settings (assuming FTP user as `codex` and Web user as `www-data`):
{{{
-rw-r----- codex www-data some-file.php
drwxr-x--- codex www-data some-directory
}}}

As for the cache and error log:
{{{
drwxrwx--- codex www-data cache
-rw-rw---- codex www-data error.log.php
}}}

The UNIX commands are provided below:
{{{
cd /path/to/Wordpress/wp-content/plugins/inline-google-docs;
find . -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \;
find . -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \;
chmod -R g+w ./cache;
}}}
