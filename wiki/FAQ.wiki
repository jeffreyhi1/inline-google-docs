== Which PHP version does the plugin require? ==

PHP 5.

== Does it use iframes? ==

No, it doesn't.

== How do I create zebra patterns for my tables ?==

As of v0.7, all rows and columns have an additional class that marks it as even or odd. Use these to create alternating patterns.

== How can I get the numbers to display as rounded, without decimal points? ==

The current plugin doesn't support any data manipulation (I would like to leave that to Google since they do such a great job.) To round your numbers, use the function ROUND (number, count) in your cell. Further documentation from Google is available [http://docs.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=82712&funcType=Math&query=ROUND&searchSyntaxExact=1 here].
